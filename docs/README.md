# Parthenon documentation

This file provides an overview of different (not necessarily all) features in Parthenon
and how to use them.

## Short feature description

Short feature descriptions may directly go in here with, for example, a link to a (unit)
test illustrating its usage.

### ParthenonManager

This class provides a streamlined capability to write new applications by providing a simple interface to initialize and finalize a simulation.  It's usage is straightforward and demonstrated in the &pi; [example](../example/calculate_pi/calculate_pi.cpp).

## Long feature description

For features that require more detailed documentation a short paragraph or sentence here
is sufficient with a link to a more detailed description in a separate [file](feature.md).
