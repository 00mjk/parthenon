# Parthenon documentation

This file provides an overview of different (not necessarily all) features in Parthenon
and how to use them.

## Short feature description

Short feature descriptions may directly go in here with, for example, a link to a (unit)
test illustrating its usage.

## Long feature description

For features that require more detailed documentation a short paragraph or sentence here
is sufficient with a link to a more detailed description in a separate [file](feature.md).
